    <h1 class="mb-4">Purpose of the ICSPS Maturity Assessment Tool</h1>

    <p>
        The <strong>Immunization Supply Chain and Forecasting and Supply Planning (ICSPS) Maturity Assessment Tool</strong>
        is designed to help countries assess their vaccine forecasting and supply planning (FSP) maturity level.
        To be effective, immunization forecasting and supply planning must be <strong>proactive rather than reactive</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        This tool evaluates a country’s maturity level by examining key characteristics across several critical components.
        These collectively strengthen the country’s capacity for effective forecasting and supply planning,
        through collaboration among all relevant stakeholders.
    </p>

    <p>The tool assesses maturity in the following <strong>six domains</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>FSP Policies, Commitment, and Political Will</li>
        <li>Data</li>
        <li>Analysis</li>
        <li>Forecasting and Supply Planning Activities</li>
        <li>Funding and Adjustments of Forecasts and Supply Plans</li>
        <li>Gender, Equity, and Social Inclusion (GESI)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Each of these components contributes to the overall goal of enabling countries to ensure proactive and equitable
        forecasting and supply planning. The tool categorizes countries into three stages of maturity:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ad-hoc forecasting and supply planning</li>
        <li>Reactive forecasting and supply planning</li>
        <li>Proactive forecasting and supply planning (ideal state)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mt-5">About GESI Integration</h2>
    <p>
        The tool also considers <strong>Gender, Equity, and Social Inclusion (GESI)</strong>.
        This refers to the intentional consideration of how different groups—such as women, men, adolescents,
        people with disabilities, and those in remote or underserved areas—experience access to health services,
        including immunization.
    </p>
    <p>
        GESI integration does not expand the technical scope of FSP, which remains focused on estimating vaccine needs
        and ensuring timely supply. Instead, it enhances the accuracy, responsiveness, and inclusiveness of FSP by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Promoting use of disaggregated data (e.g., by sex, age, geography)</li>
        <li>Supporting coordination with GESI experts</li>
        <li>Ensuring diverse representation in FSP teams</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This approach ensures that <strong>no population is left behind</strong>, while aligning FSP with broader equity goals.</p>

    <h2 class="mt-5">Instructions</h2>
    <p>
        The tool will be completed by country EPI teams participating in the ICSPS initiative.
        For each of the questions, please select the answer that best describes the status in the country,
        particularly the EPI Team, the National Logistics Working Group for Immunization,
        or any other task force/body responsible for vaccine supply and demand planning.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have any key comments, please provide them at the bottom of each section.
        The assessment will be completed quarterly and will guide improvement planning.
    </p>
